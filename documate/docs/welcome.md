# Welcome to Packem

Packem is a compiled JavaScript module bundler built specifically to make development with Web tools an easy task. Packem is primarily written in Rust and thus gains many features like a strong type system, portable executables and a blazing fast concurrency model. What makes it unique is that most concepts of common JavaScript module bundlers (c. [#01](/)) do not fit in which necessates a newer implementation of the same idea using different approaches while still maintaining the basics.
