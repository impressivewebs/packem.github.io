# Compilem, The Compiler

A standalone source-to-source compiler adopted through Packem and implemented in [Rust](/) that just works. This section covers everything about Compilem.

Since Babel's transpilation process doesn't conform to Packem's main principle (performance), a solution needed to come at hand. Instead of _'just going along with'_ Babel and putting in absolutely no effort to boost its speed (as seen in other bundlers), we forced ourselves to accept the reality of what is really happening in typical 'modern' JavaScript toolchains.
