# Packem Documentation Site

This is a remote clone of React's site which was heavily changed to fit our needs. That apart, it is a WIP. React's site [provides a README with details of setting up](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org). None of the instructions was distorted. Follow the instructions along to contribute to Packem's site.

## Clone the `dev` branch

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch <branchname> host:/dir.git
```
