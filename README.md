# Packem Documentation

This repo contains all the docs (including statically rendered HTML) of [@packem](https://github.com/packem/) and other associated repos. The docs are in Markdown format and are located in the `documate/docs` folder.

## Documate

Current version (in use): `v1.0.2`

[Documate](http://documate.netlify.com) is a simplistic tool we'll be using to generate our docs into portable HTML. While it is not in a perfect state, regular updates on it is in progress. Ideally, the Markdown docs are transformed into a stable static build.

## Contributing

Note: The general [Packem Contribution Guidelines]() still apply.

1. The docs have to be in line with the latest version of Packem.
2. Only contributors and/or core members are allowed to make changes to the docs.
3. The docs must be semantically ordered so that they appear in `documate/nav.md`
4. Two or more contributors and/or core members MUST approve of the changes.
5. Any linking, references and/or direct mentions of other bundlers pertaining to any form of comparison to Packem MUST be substantially benchmarked.
6. Effort must be made to manually proof-read the docs as the rest of the team handle the other sections.
7. All changes must be based on existing ideas. No new ideas or unimplemented goals must be documented.
8. Pure Markdown must be used since no Markdown extensions are included in Documate.
