# Getting Started

This section outlines how to install and configure Packem to get you started. Based off a simple app, you could extend your needs further to fit your requirements.

## Installation

To install Packem, your system needs to meet a few requirements:

- [Node (_v10_, _v9_ or _v8_)](https://nodejs.org/) **must** be installed (with *npm*). If you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), then follow along with the appropriate commands.

> **Note**: Packem binaries are not available for Windows but are expected soon.

Through your terminal, run:

```bash
# Default installation method (with npm)
npm install -g packem

# For Yarn, run
yarn global add packem
```

It is highly recommended to install Packem globally so that any version update could allow multiple Packem projects to compile using the latest installed version. You can check more about the versionings [here](https://github.com/packem/packem/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Alternatively, you could install it locally then use a package runner like [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx) to run Packem on your project locally.

After installing Packem, setting up your workspace environment will be a matter of adding a single YAML file at the root of your project. Packem needs this configuration file to tell exactly what and how your code should be bundled.

## Creating the configuration file

In the root of your project's file structure, add a new file and name it `packem.config.yml`. This file will contain all the necessary configuration options for your project. In this file, copy the following content into it and save.

```yaml
root: "./src/index.js"
output: "./dist/bundle.js"
```

As you might've noticed, the `root` field is where the bundling process starts and the `output` field is where your final concatenated bundle ends up. You need to point to a file to get the root and output right. Packem takes care of the rest of the process according to how you've defined it.

> **Note**: Only the `root` and `output` fields are necessary.

## Using Packem's CLI to start bundling

From the terminal, run the `packem` command in the root directory of your project. When the bundling process is finish, return back to your project and check the output folder you specified (i.e. `./dist/bundle.js`).

The next section will show you how to write more sophisticated configurations to the point it would be second nature.
