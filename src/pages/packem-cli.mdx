# Packem CLI

The CLI tool is relatively primitive and currently only supports limited subcommands/flags. Packem prefers to keep most necessary configuration details in the `packem.config.yml` file. Refer to the [Configurations](/configurations) section to learn more on configuration.

## Commands list

Here's a list of all CLI subcommands/flags supported by the latest of versions. Options can precede any subcommand but can occur in any order at the same time.

Usage: `packem <command> [options]`

### Options

| **Option**   | **Description**
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------
| `version`, `v` | Prints the version of the Packem installation used
| `help`, `h` | Prints a help message containing the command list
| `verbose`     | Increases the verbosity level of outputs
