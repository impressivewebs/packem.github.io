- ## Extremely Fast
  Packem is **+2X faster than Parcel (with multicore compilation)**.
  It leverages **close-to-the-metal** Rust bindings to achieve zero-cost
  abstractions and fearless concurrency. The runtime context uses
  [`node-worker-farm`](https://github.com/rvagg/node-worker-farm)
  for distributive multithreading on larger module graphs.

- ## Safe Binaries
  Packem is precompiled into safe and efficient binaries. The upcoming *v1.0 stable* is
  expected to implement most parts of the runtime context in Rust, hence improved
  speeds.

- ## Versatile Plugin System
  A comprehensive *class-based* approach is used to instantiate and rehydrate plugins into the bundling cycle.
  The `PackemEventDispatcher` API can be used to manage internal event hooks and create custom ones during build time.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Performance Comparisons</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    This is a performance comparison between Packem and a few other common bundlers based on [lodash v4.17](https://github.com/bukharim96/packem-lodash-test#packem-lodash-test). The host machine's specs can be found [here]().
