# Roadmap

Packem makes sure to increase development and user experiences extensively. However, we need your support to create a future where we can bundle painlessly.

This section is updated regularly according to what features should be preferred. It is not in an order but you can follow up this section to find your requirements. If there is something missing, please report it to us by filing an issue with the `enhancement` filter.

## Feature Requests

- WebAssembly support for standalone usage of Packem in the browser or any other platforms that support native WASM execution. The runtime context will not be moved into WASM even though it would be effortless. This feature was requested by [Axel Rauschmayer](https://twitter.com/rauschma) and can be found at issue [#1](https://github.com/packem/packem/issues/1).
