To install Packem, your system needs to meet a few requirements:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) **must** be installed (with *npm*). If you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), then follow along with the appropriate commands.

Through your terminal, run:

```bash
# Default installation method (with npm)
npm install -g packem

# For Yarn, run
yarn add --global packem
```

It is highly recommended to install Packem globally so that any version update could allow multiple Packem projects to compile using the latest installed version. You can check more about the versionings [here](/versions). Alternatively, you could install it locally then use a package runner like [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx) to run Packem on your project.

Another guide on installing Packem locally is expected soon.
