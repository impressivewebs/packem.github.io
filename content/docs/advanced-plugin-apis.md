This section covers all the nitty gritty details of creating Packem plugins to the extent of being able to create custom events to allow plugins to hook onto during compile time using the `PackemEventDispatcher`.

Packem's plugins follow a general procedure. You'll need to understand all the plugin rules that you need to conform to before being able to carry on with this section.

## General Plugin Rules

There are a few procedures that one needs to take into account to **create**, **publish** and **use** a plugin(s):

- Your plugin's package name (i.e. in the `package.json`) must be in the form `packem-<name>-plugin` where `<name>` (without the angle brackets) is your plugin name.
- Your package must export **ONLY ONE** class that extends `PackemPlugin`.
- All plugins fall under the `plugins` field in the config, relative to `root`, `output` and `transformer`.
- If a plugin is defined in the config _and is listed to be a common plugin_, it must follow the format `<name>-plugin`. A common plugin is any plugin under the packem scope on npm like `@packem/dev-plugin`, `@packem/file-plugin`. You can find more about common plugins [here](https://github.com/packem/packem/blob/master/docs/common-plugins.md).
- If a plugin is defined in the config _and is custom_, it must follow the format `packem-<name>-plugin`. Packem can pick this from your plugin's `package.json`. This means your plugin's class doesn't need to follow any format so this is fine.

    ```module.exports = class FunkyApple extends PackemPlugin {}```

- A correctly defined plugin has access to any option(s) passed to it via using `this.pluginConfig` (a prototype property available for every plugin). For example, if you pass an option `isCool: true` to the plugin, you can refer to it by using `this.pluginConfig` anywhere in your plugin's class whereby it returns an object.
- If no options are to be passed to a plugin, you must indicate that it is available so that the object notion is not broken. A YAML-compliant truthy boolean is preferable, particularly `on`. Other truthy booleans include `ON`, `yes` and `YES`, `true` and `TRUE`. For example, `packem-custom-addon-plugin: on` is correct.
- **Plugins are executed in order of definition (FIFO &mdash; First In, First Out)**. Other bundlers like webpack would pipe several loaders but Packem decided to execute plugins in order of definition to make configuring much less of a pain.

## Module Interfaces

We've dealt with event hooks and successfully used the right event to do what we needed. But what is a module interface anyway?

**A module interface is an exact in-memory copy of a mutable reference of a module from the module graph available from the LC/RC**. Note that this reference doesn't affect the filesystem i.e. it is _read-only_ and just points to a file. Just like an OS can display file metadata, Packem provides metadata for modules in the module graph as module interfaces. Not all properties can be satisfied for all files like JavaScript vs non-JavaScript file types. A module interface is always in this form:

```typescript
interface ModuleInterface {
  // The mangled ID used to refer to this module.
  id: string;
  // The absolute path of this module.
  path: string;
  // A tracker that defines whether this module is dynamic or not.
  // If it is equivalent to "root", then it is not dynamic. Otherwise, it is.
  // 
  // Quick Hack: To check if a module is dynamically imported anywhere,
  // 
  //    onModuleBundle(mod: ModuleInterface) {
  //       let isDynamicModule: boolean = mod.bundle_id !== "root";
  //       // Do something with `isDynamicModule`
  //    }
  // 
  bundle_id: string;
  // The file extension of this module.
  extension: string;
  // Content of this module which doesn't exist on non-JavaScript
  // files so don't use it if you're matching a non-text-based file type.
  content?: string;
  // An array of mangled IDs that represent a module on the flat list
  // module graph. When bundling this module with its dependencies it
  // is recursively looped over until all its dependency's sub-dependencies
  // have been exhaustively transformed then taken to the serializer (when
  // the same happens to the whole module graph).
  dependencies: string[];
}
```

## Built-in events

Here's a list of all the built-in plugin events in order of dispatch right from the beginning of the bundling cycle till the very end.

### `onStart`

**Parameters:** `ConfigurationObject`.

**Returns:** `void`.

This event is dispatched before the module graph is generated.

### The `ConfigurationObject`

The configuration object is a slightly modified version of `packem.config.yml`. It includes a few extra fields.

```typescript
interface ConfigurationObject {
  // The root module is where the resolver starts to track
  // dependencies and rehydrate them into the module graph.
  root: string;
  // Output bundle generated by the transformer.
  output: string;
  // Absolute path to the root module.
  rootPath: string;
  // Absolute path to the output bundle.
  outputPath: string;
  // Absolute path to the output bundle's directory.
  // If the output path is `./dist/bundle.js`, the equivalent
  // `outputDir` would be the absolute path prepended to `./dist/` only.
  outputDir: string;
  // Output path file name without extension.
  // If the output directory is `./dist/bundle.main.js`, then
  // the equivalent `outputPathFileStem` would be `bundle.main`
  // i.e. without `.js`.
  outputPathFileStem: string;
}
```

```typescript
onStart(config: ConfigurationObject) {
  // Logs configuration file to stdout.
  console.log(config);
}
```

### `onGenerateModuleGraph`

**Parameters:** `ModuleGraph`.

**Returns:** `void`.

Allows manipulation of the graph before `onModuleBundle`. This method is especially useful when you wish to reset all module interfaces in a graph to fit your needs after which you could use `onModuleBundle` to get your customized version of the graph.

```typescript
onGenerateModuleGraph(graph: ModuleGraph) {
  // Clear all dependencies before you call `onModuleBundle`.
  graph.root.dependencies = [];
}
```

### `onModuleBundle`

**Parameters:** `ModuleInterface`

**Returns:** `string` Overriden content of the current module. If you need a module to export the return value prepend your return value with the string `"module.exports = "`.

One of the most commonly used events. Fires when the transformer is running through the module graph in the runtime context. It gives access to the module interface of every module in the graph.

```typescript
onModuleBundle(mod: ModuleInterface): string {
  return "module.exports = " + mod.content;
}
```

### `onBeforeTransform`

**Parameters:** `ModuleInterface`

**Returns:** `void`.

Triggered just before the transformer kicks in. If you wish to run something before a Babel preset(s) and/or plugin(s) is included use this event.

```typescript
onBeforeTransform(mod: ModuleInterface) {
  // Do something before any Babel preset(s) and/or plugin(s)
  ;
}
```

### `onAfterTransform`

**Parameters:** `transformedCode: string`. A transformed version of the input files.

**Returns:** `void`.

Triggered just after the transformer handles JavaScript file types. Useful when you want to run something after a script is transformed.

```typescript
onAfterTransform(transformedCode: string) {
  // Access to transformed code i.e. transformer's output.
  console.log(transformedCode);
}
```

### `onSuccess`

**Parameters:** None.

**Returns:** `void`.

This event is dispatched when the bundling cycle is successfully complete.

```typescript
onSuccess() {
  console.log("Successfully bundled everything! ðŸ‘Œ");
}
```

### `onEnd`

**Parameters:** `config: ConfigurationObject`. A transformed version of `packem.config.yml` exhibiting [this format](https://github.com/packem/packem/blob/master/docs/the-plugin-system.md#the-configurationobject).

**Returns:** `void`.

After every core process is complete, this event is dispatched.

```typescript
onEnd(config: ConfigurationObject) {
  // All core process are complete. Only plugins or child
  // processes are expected to be running.
  console.log(config);
}
```
