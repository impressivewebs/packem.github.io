Packem is **+2X faster than Parcel (with multicore compilation)**. It leverages close-to-the-metal Rust bindings to achieve zero-cost abstractions and fearless concurrency. The [RC](http://localhost:8000/docs/execution-contexts.html) uses `node-worker-farm` for distributive multithreading on larger module graphs.
