Packem is **+2X faster than Parcel (with multicore compilation)**. It leverages close-to-the-metal Rust bindings to achieve zero-cost abstractions and fearless concurrency. The [RC](http://localhost:8000/docs/bundling-contexts.html) relies on V8's `JSON.parse()` for [faster parsing](https://twitter.com/mathias/status/1151503069676482562) of larger module graphs.
