**Packem is ~2X faster than [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/)**. It abstracts most heavy operations to [Rusty](https://www.rust-lang.org/) dynamic libraries. This reduces compilation time by a huge fraction. Additionally, safe FFI connections are leveraged to apply native ABIs to your workspace.

Check the [advanced section]() to find more on the Packem's runtime procedure.
