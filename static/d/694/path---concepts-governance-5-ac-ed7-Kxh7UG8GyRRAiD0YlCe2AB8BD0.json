In particular, this means having humility, being open to feedback and changing their mind, knowing the limits of their abilities and being able to communicate all of these things such that it is noticed. Good judgement is what produces trust, not quality, quantity or pure technical skill.</p>\n<p>When we believe a core contributor would make a great ambassador for Ghost and feel able to trust them to make good decisions about its future - that's generally when we'll ask them to become a member of the formal Core Team.</p>\n<p>Core Team members are granted commit rights to Ghost projects, access to the Ghost Foundation private Slack, and occasionally join our international team retreats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"community-guidelines\"><a href=\"#community-guidelines\" aria-label=\"community guidelines permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Community guidelines</h2>\n<p>All participation in the Ghost community is subject to our incredibly straightforward <a href=\"https://ghost.org/conduct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">code of conduct</a> and wider <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/t/faq-guidelines/5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">community guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the Ghost community is incredible, and we work hard to make sure it stays that way.
